## Overview

Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- What was your experience? I improved on my understanding of react. Worked with and learnt more about props and states, also structuring component layouts(basically learning how to think in components). Looking to get better working with react henceforth.

- Your wisdom? :) Just do it.
